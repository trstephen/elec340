\section{Procedure}\label{sec:procedure}
We created a cylindrical structure in \mefisto{} that had perfect magnetic boundaries. The structure had an outer wall, a top and bottom and it was filled with air. It contained a distributed source, a probe and an animation region. We used a simulation mesh, initially with a grid spacing of 1mm, which we then changed to 0.5mm. 


For the magnetic cavity, we excited it with an impulse and measured the resonance frequencies on the 1mm grid and on the 0.5 mm grid. We then excited the cavity with a Gaussian impulse with s frequency of 11.5 GHz, close to the measured resonance frequency and integrated the magnetic and electric fields over the animation region.  This will verify Faraday's Law.


We also created a cavity very similar to the magnetic one, with perfect electrical boundaries and filled it with air.  We excited this magnetic cavity with the same Gaussian impulse with a resonance frequency of 11.5 GHz. Then we integrated the magnetic and electric fields over the animation region of the electric cavity. This will verify Ampere's Law.
