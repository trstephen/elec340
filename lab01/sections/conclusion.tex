\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
The simulation was an effective tool to see how the electric and magnetic waves are resonating in a perfect electrical and magnetic cavity, respectively. The different results in amplitude illustrate the effect of the location of the probe and the time varying nature of the waves.
