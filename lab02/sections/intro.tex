\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
Faraday's and Ampere's Laws can be applied \cite[pp. 15-16]{lab-manual} to a medium with constant permittivity and permeability to yeild the Helmholtz equation:
\begin{equation}
	\del^2 \phasor{E} = - \omega^2 \mu \epsilon \phasor{E} = \gamma^2 \phasor{E}.
\end{equation}
This relation implies that \emph{something...}

\textit{More about intrinsic impedance effect on propagation.}

\textit{A little bit about polarization.}
