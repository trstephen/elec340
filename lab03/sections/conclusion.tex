\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
The simulations in the lab vividly showed the electromagnetic theory that governs plane wave transmissions and reflections in a material at normal incidence.
It demonstrated how the waves behave in the first and second medium, especially the interactions of the incident wave and the reflected wave in the first medium. 

The simulation software can be used to check the calculations to see if the simulation and the calculation match up.
The reflection and transmission problems can be calculated using Smith charts. 

Electromagnetic transformers can be designed using the material properties and using materials with specific permittivity and adjusting the length of material sections to allow a specific amount of transmission.
