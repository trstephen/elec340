\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
This lab gave us a good understanding of the behavior of electromagnetic waves at boundaries as well as of how to simulate waves at oblique incidences.
Snell's Law is insufficient in explaining electromagnetic reflection because it does not account for any transmission for angles beyond the critical angle.
This is contrary to the simulation and is explained by the boundary conditions, which require perpendicular components to be equal (when scaled by the permittivity) at the boundary.

The Brewster angle structure showed how waves can be transmitted without causing reflection.
Our work with the waveguides showed the relationship between the material dimensions of the structure and the allowable transmission frequencies.
