\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
This experiment used \mefisto{} to explore the refraction of electromagnetic waves at oblique incidence.
Waves at \SI{45}{\degree} incidence were explored with different permittivity transitions. 

A Brewster angle interface was constructed so that an electromagnetic wave could strike at oblique incidence but not experience reflection.
This occurs when the incidence is
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:brewster}
	\tan\theta_B = \sqrt{{\epsilon_2 \over \epsilon_1}}.
\end{equation}
The behavior of electromagnetic waves in a cavity was examined next.
An impulse function was used to determine the resonant frequencies of a cavity with $a = \SI{30}{mm}$ and $b = \SI{20}{\milli\meter}$.
These resonant frequencies determine which transmission modes will be permitted.

Lastly, we downloaded a pre-built \mefisto{} waveguide and altered the mode and generating frequency to create new transmission modes for the same waveguide.
